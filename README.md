## Data:
###### We are using a 120 years dataset from Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/code/duttadebadri/analysing-the-olympics-for-last-120-yrs/data?select=athlete_events.csv

## Description:
###### After considerable analysis into a number of datasets, 120 Years of Olympic Games is being examined for representation. Its dataset has a range of benefits, including the fact that it is a large-scale dataset that spans the years 1896 to 2016. Last but not least, the Olympic Games dataset is seen to be worthwhile analysing in terms of visual representation and user experience.  A data set from Kaggle was chosen to solve the main question, which consists of two unique tables, athlete events, and event regions.
The problems being solved can be a multitude of problems.  Which countries are the most dominant? How has involvement evolved? Which countries have the most medals in various disciplines? What is the ratio of female/male Olympic attendees?. What factors of an athlete influence the success rate of a country
