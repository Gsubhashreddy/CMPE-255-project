## Abstract
   #### The census is a unique, wide-ranging activity that occurs once every ten years across the country. The goal is to collect data on the general public in order to offer a complete and accurate image of the country's population, including housing conditions, demographic, social, and economic features. Age, gender, place of origin, marital status, housing conditions, marriage, education, and employment are among the data collected. The purpose of this machine learning research is to estimate whether or not a person earns more than $50,000 per year based on their demographics. Several classification strategies are investigated, with the Adaboost classification model providing the best prediction result.

## Introduction
   The income of the citizens has a significant impact on a country's economic well-being.
   
   Many business and public sector choices are dependent on Census data. The democratic form of governance relies heavily on census data, which has a significant impact on the economy. The government distributes federal cash to different states and localities using census-related data.
   
Not just for the reasons stated above, but also for post-census population estimates and predictions, economic and social scientific research, and a variety of other uses. As a result, the significance of this data and its accurate forecasts is obvious to us.
Many crucial judgments have always been based on data. When an assumption is supported by facts and figures, the odds of being wrong and making poor judgments are reduced.

We're using data from a 1994 income survey conducted by the US Census Bureau. With this dataset, we want to solve the problem of identifying persons who make more than $50,000. This information can be useful to non-profit or philanthropic organizations. Understanding an individual's income can assist a non-profit in determining how large of a donation to request, as well as whether or not to contact out in the first place.
