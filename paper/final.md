## Abstract
   #### The census is a unique, wide-ranging activity that occurs once every ten years across the country. The goal is to collect data on the general public in order to offer a complete and accurate image of the country's population, including housing conditions, demographic, social, and economic features. Age, gender, place of origin, marital status, housing conditions, marriage, education, and employment are among the data collected. The purpose of this machine learning research is to estimate whether or not a person earns more than $50,000 per year based on their demographics. Several classification strategies are investigated, with the Adaboost classification model providing the best prediction result.
